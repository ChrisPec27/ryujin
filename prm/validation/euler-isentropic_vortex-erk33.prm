##
#
# Euler (optimized polytropic gas EOS) benchmark:
#
# The isentropic vortex is an analytic solution of the compressible Euler
# equations (with polytropic gas equation of state). We compute the vortex
# on the square [-5, 5]^2 initially centered at (-1,-1) with a strength of
# beta=5, and moving in diagonal (1,1) direction with mach number 1. At
# final time t=2 the vortex is located at (1, 1). We report the final,
# normalized L1, L2, L\infty error norms summed up over all components.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping.
# Expected results are reported in euler-isentropic_vortex-erk33.baseline
